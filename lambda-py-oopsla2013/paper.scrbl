@abstract{

We present a small-step operational semantics for the Python
programming language.  We present both a core language for Python,
suitable for tools and proofs, and a translation process for
converting Python source to this core.  We have tested the composition
of translation and evaluation of the core for conformance with the
primary Python implementation, thereby giving confidence in the
fidelity of the semantics. We briefly report on the engineering of
these components. Finally, we examine subtle aspects of the language,
identifying scope as a pervasive concern that even impacts features
that might be considered orthogonal.

@section{Introduction}

@section{Motivation and Contributions}

Python is a widely-used scripting
language@note{https://github.com/blog/841-those-are-some-big-numbers} with a
reputation for simplicity and expressivity.  There are a number of tools for
Python, from style and lint-checkers,@note{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint,
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8} to simple static
checkers,@note{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes} to code analyzers that
import and run code to analyze
it.@note{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyChecker}.  There are also a number of
IDEs for Python, which provide tools like variable name refactoring and code
completion@note{http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/, http://pydev.org/,
http://wingware.com/, among others}.  These tools are all useful, but all are
built on an ad hoc understanding of Python, and provide little in the way of
@emph{guarantees}; in [REF] we note that a simple 8 line program, which uses no
so-called ``dynamic'' features, confuses their variable rename refactoring
because of a wrinkle in Pythonic scope

This is not to say that developers shouldn't use these tools; they are
certainly invaluable for organizing projects, providing symbol completion, and
managing build and deployments.  They could be made even more helpful, however,
if their predictions about programs and refactoring tools could be defined
rigorously and with respect to a semantics for Python, rather than in a
best-effort manner over the Python AST data structure they happen to use.

Indeed, as Python becomes even more widely used, and in even more
correctness-sensitive domains, a precise understanding of programs written in
Python becomes even more important.  The Securities and Exchange Commission has
proposed using Python as an executable specification of financial
contracts@note{https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2010/33-9117.pdf}, and Python
is becoming a scripting language of choice for programming new network
paradigms@note{http://www.noxrepo.org/pox/about-pox/}.  Is an informal
understanding of the language sufficient for such domains?  Having a precise
semantics available for analyzing and proving properties of programs is a much
more comfortable situation for these applications to be in.

In this paper, we present a tested semantics for several features of Python
3.2.3.@note{http://www.python.org/getit/releases/3.2.3/, released April 2012}
As concrete contributions and artifacts, we have produced and will discuss in
this paper:

@itemlist[

  @item{A @emph{core semantics} for Python, dubbed @(lambda-py), which is implemented
  in Redex (and was used to typeset the figures in this document);}

  @item{An @emph{interpreter}, dubbed @(lambda-interp), implemented in 800LOC
  of Racket, that is a more efficient implementation of @(lambda-py), tested
  against the Redex model;}

  @item{A @emph{desugaring} translation from Python programs to @(lambda-py),
  implemented in Racket and described here in prose and pseudocode;}

  @item{The results of @emph{testing} the composition of desugaring with
  @(lambda-interp) against a real Python implementation, to demonstrate conformance
  of @(lambda-py) with real-world Python.}

]

This suite of artifacts is a meaningful contribution in itself, regardless of
any new insights into programming languages theory or practice.  It constitutes
a formal description of the language, and a mathematical foundation for
applying well-known programming language techniques to complex, real-world
applications written in Python.

Along with these concrete implementation and mathematical contributions, we
also provide some more high-level insight into several feature interactions
within Python.  Most notably, Python's scope interacts heavily with both
classes and control flow (in the form of generators), making those features
difficult to understand independently.  In [REF], We show how we untangle the
tight coupling of these features, and manage to express them in a traditional
calculus of scope, control, and objects.

@subsection{Outline} Presenting the entirety of Python's semantics and its
translation to @(lambda-py) is out of the scope of this document, so we focus
on a few particular areas.  We first give an overview Python's value and object
model, whose richness allows many of the other patterns we see in the language.
We then show how many Pythonic patterns for iteration and overloading can be
implemented as straightforward expansions to patterns in this object model.
This also serves as an introduction to the concept of @emph{desugaring} the
surface language to the core.  Next, we tackle Python's unique treatment of
scope for variables and closures, and how it interacts with both classes and a
naïve understanding of generators.  After explaining our model of scope, we
show how generators can be implemented with local CPS.  Finally, we describe
the results of testing our desugaring and interpreter against CPython to ensure
its fidelity to real-world Python programs.

@section{Warmup: Pythonic Values and Objects}

An expressive object model is one of the core features of Python.  Pythons
object and class system has support for single and multiple inheritance, static
and instance members and methods, monkey-patching, proxying, and more.


@subsection{Built-in Values}

Python has a few commonly-used built-in datatypes with rich (but implicit)
interfaces.  Dictionaries, tuples, and lists are all supported directly in
Python syntax, and all implement their own overloading of common operations:

@verbatim{
s = "str"
d = { "dictionaries":  "with",
      0:               "or more ",
      "comp" + "uted": "keys" }
t = ("heter", 0, "geneous tuples")
l = ["heter", 0, "geneous lists"]
st = {"heter", 0, "geneous sets"}
assert(len(s) == len(d) == len(t)
    == len(l) == len(s) == 3)
assert(s[0] == "s")
assert(d[0] == "or more")
assert(t[0] == l[0] == "heter")
}

All of these builtin values have special, builtin behavior that cannot be
completely emulated by programmers in Python.  We give these values
distinguished forms in our semantics.  However, these builtin values are
@emph{not} the values of the language themselves.  They only appear as part of
a larger object value.  Every value that the Python programmer sees truly is
an object: there is no such thing as a ``primitive string'' that a programmer
can directly get a reference to in Python.

@subsubsection{Creating Values}

@Figure-ref["f:values"] shows the representation of values in @(lambda-py).
Each @(lambda-py) object, written as a triple of the form @(lp-term (obj-val val mval ((string ref) ...))), has distinguished positions for its class, its primitive
content (if any), and the dictionary of string-indexed fields that it holds.
The class value is any other Python value, though non-objects may end up
throwing runtime errors.  The @emph{meta-val} position holds special kinds of
builtin data, of which there is one per builtin type that @(lambda-py) models.

As an example, we'll step through the various stages of constructing and using
a built-in list in @(lambda-py).  Lists are built with object expressions,
which have two pieces: the @emph{class} of the object being constructed, and
the @emph{meta-val}, if any, that stores primitive data.  The expression for
creating an empty list is:

@centered[
  @(lp-term (list (id %list localid) ()))
]

Where @(lp-term (id %list localid)) is expected to be bound to the built-in
list class.  In general, the first position of a list expression is the
@emph{class} of the list object to create.  This must be a part of the list
expression because programmers can subclass the builtin @code{list} class and
create values that can use all the built-in list primitives, but have their
own set of methods.  The second part of the expression is a list of
expressions that will evaluate to the elements of the list.  For example, a
list containing the numbers 1 and 3 is written:

@(define (lst1)
  (lp-term (list (id %list localid) ((object (id %int localid) (meta-num 1)) (object (id %int localid) (meta-num 3))))))

@centered[
  @(lst1)
]

The object creation expressions for numbers similarly indicate that the
@(lp-term %int) class should be used for their methods.  The rule for
evaluating list expressions themselves allocates a new location on the heap
for the resulting list, and constructs a value with the given class and a
list-typed @(lp-term mval) to hold its elements:

@centered[
  @(lp-reduction '("E-List"))
]

Here, the @"@" indicates a reference value, which is pointing to a new object
which is added to the store Σ.  This also shows the shape of reductions for
@(lambda-py), which is a small-step relation over triples of expressions
@(lp-term e), environment lists @(lp-term εs),@note{We discuss the need for a
list of environments, rather than just a single environment, in [REF].} and
stores @(lp-term Σ).  We define evaluation contexts @(lp-term E) in the usual
way to enforce an evaluation order on expressions.

In this style, to fully evaluate @(lst1), the reduction would
allocate 3 new references: one for each number, and one for the resulting
list:

@itemlist[
  @item{@(lp-term (Σ(ref_list))) = @(lp-term (obj-val %list (meta-list ((pointer-val ref_one) (pointer-val ref_three))) ()))}
  @item{@(lp-term (Σ(ref_one))) = @(lp-term (obj-val %int (meta-num 1) ()))}
  @item{@(lp-term (Σ(ref_three))) = @(lp-term (obj-val %int (meta-num 3) ()))}
]

And the reference value @(lp-term (pointer-val ref_list)) would be placed back
into the active context.  Similar rules for tuples, dictionaries, and sets are
shown in @figure-ref["f:steps-values"].

@figure["f:steps-values" (elem (lambda-py) " reduction rules for creating objects")]{
  @(lp-reduction '("E-Object" "E-Tuple" "E-Set" "E-List"))
}

@subsubsection{Accessing Built-in Values}

@figure*["f:delta" (elem "A sample of " (lambda-py) " primitives")]{
  @(lp-metafunction δ '(0 1 2 3))
}

@figure["f:references" (elem (lambda-py) " reduction rules for references")]{
  @(lp-reduction '("E-Fetch" "E-Set!" "E-Alloc"))
}

Now that we've created a list, we should be able to perform some operations on
it, like look up its elements.  @(lambda-py) defines a number of builtin
primitives that model Python's internal operators for manipulating data, and
these are used to access the contents of a given object's @(lp-term mval).  We
formalize these builtin primitives in a metafunction δ.  A few selected cases
of the δ function are shown in @figure-ref["f:delta"].  This metafunction lets
us, for example, look up values on builtin lists:

@centered{
  @(lp-term (prim "list-getitem" ((obj-val %list (meta-list ((obj-val %str (meta-str "first-elt") ()))) ())
                                  (obj-val %int (meta-num 0) ()))))
  @(newline)
  @(lp-term ==>)
  @(lp-term (obj-val %str (meta-str "first-elt") ()))
}

Since δ works over object values themselves, and not over references, we need
a way to access the values in the store.  @(lambda-py) has the usual set of
operators for accessing and updating mutable references, shown in
@figure-ref["f:references"].  The real version of the program above would look
more like:

@centered{
  @(lp-term (prim "list-getitem" ((fetch (list (id %list local) ((obj-val %str (meta-str "first-elt") ()))))
                                  (fetch (object (id %int local) (meta-num 0))))))
}

Similarly, we can use @(lp-term set!) and @(lp-term alloc) to update the
values in lists, and to allocate the return values of primitive operations.

@subsection{Updating and Accessing Fields}

So far, the dictionary part of @(lambda-py) objects have always been empty.
Python does, however, support arbitrary field assignments on objects.  The
expression

@centered{
  @(lp-term (assign (get-field e_obj str_f) := e_val))
}

has one of two behaviors, defined in @figure-ref["f:simple-objs"].  If @(lp-term
str_f) is a string that is already a member of @(lp-term e_obj), that field is
imperatively updated with @(lp-term e_val).  If the string is not present,
then a new field is added to the object, with a newly-allocated store
position, and the object is functionally updated.  We combine this functional
update with @(lp-term set!) expressions on reference values in order to model
objects with an imperatively extended set of fields.

The simplest rule for accessing fields simply checks in the object's dictionary
for the provided name and returns the appropriate value, shown in E-GetField in
@figure-ref["f:simple-objs"].  E-GetField works over reference values, rather
than objects directly, because we will need it in the next section to handle
the binding of @(lp-term self) references.  [FILL why are they literal strings
and not meta-vals that contain strings?]

@figure*["f:simple-objs" @elem{Simple field access and update in @(lambda-py)}]{
  @(lp-reduction '("E-AssignUpdate" "E-AssignAdd" "E-GetField"))
}

@subsection{First-class Functions}


We represent function values in the usual way, as abstractions that store a
list of environments:@note{We discuss in [REF] why we store an environment
@emph{list} instead of just a single environment}.  As shown in
@figure-ref["f:functions"], function expressions @(lp-term (fun (x ...) e))
evaluate to closures that store the current list @(lp-term εs).  Python also
allows for variable-arity functions, which we explicitly support in the
semantics via an extra argument that holds all additional values passed to the
function beyond those in the list @(lp-term (x ...)).

@figure*["f:functions" @elem{Evaluating function expressions}]{
  @(lp-reduction '("E-Fun"))
}

[FILL] functions as objects.

The full language of expressions for @(lambda-py) is in
@figure-ref["f:exprs"].  We defer a full explanation of all the terms in that
semantics, and the full reduction relation, to the appendix [REF].  We
continue here by focusing on some of the cases in the semantics that are
unique to Python.

@figure["f:exprs" (elem (lambda-py) " expressions")]{
  @(with-rewriters
    (lambda () (render-language λπ #:nts '(e t))))
}


@section{Classes, Methods, and Pythonic Desugarings}

The first complex feature of Python we address is a featureful first-class
class system.  We'll discuss how @(lambda-py) models its lookup algorithm
(including multiple inheritance) and its mechanism for binding the self
parameter in first-class methods.

@subsection{Field Lookup in Classes}

In the last section, we touched on field lookup in an object's local
dictionary, and didn't discuss the purpose of the class position at all.
When an object lookup @(lp-term (get-field (obj-val val_c mval d) str))
doesn't find @(lp-term str) in the local dictionary @(lp-term d), it defers
to a lookup algorithm on the class value @(lp-term val_c).  More
specifically, it uses the @(lp-term "__mro__") field of the class to
determine which class dictionaries to search for the field.  This field is 
visible to the Python programmer:

@verbatim{
class C(object):
  pass # a class that does nothing

print(C.__mro__)
# (<class '__main__.C'>, <class 'object'>)
}

Field lookups on objects whose class value is @(lp-term C) will first look in
the dictionary of @(lp-term C), and then in the dictionary of the built-in
class @(lp-term object).  [FILL hopefully remove discussion of method binding
here]

We define this lookup algorithm within @(lambda-py) as @(lp-term class-lookup),
shown in @figure-ref["f:lookup-class"] along with the reduction rule for field
access that uses it.

@figure*["f:lookup-class" @elem{Class lookup}]{
  @para{
    @(lp-reduction '("E-GetField-Class"))
  }
  @para{
    @(lp-metafunction class-lookup #f)
  }
  @para{
    @(lp-metafunction class-lookup-mro #f)
  }
  @para{
    @(lp-metafunction maybe-bind-method #f)
  }
}

This rule and the associated metafunctions are interesting for a few reasons.
[FILL this may change as we make __getattribute__ work, so deferring an
explanation for now]


@subsection{Desugaring Classes}

In the last section, we saw that field lookup depends on a special class
pointer, and a designated @(lp-term "__mro__") field that contains the
inheritance chain of the object.  We didn't discuss how classes and their
associated @(lp-term "__mro__") field get created in the first place.  We next
briefly describe the class form in Python and some of its behavior.  Rather
than attempt to do justice to a full description here, we try to capture the
essence of how @(lambda-py) models Python's classes.

Classes are created with a special @code{class} form in Python.  The simplest
nontrivial classes can define methods by using the same @code{def} syntax as
function definitions.  The special method @code{__init__} defines a constructor
for the class, which is used to initialize fields, and variables in the class's
body are also accessible as fields of instances.  @Figure-ref["f:test-class"]
shows a simple class definition that uses these features.

@figure["f:test-class" @elem{A sample Python class definition}]{

@verbatim{
class Test(object):
  success = 'Test passed'
  failure = 'Test failed'
  def __init__(self, f):
    self.f = f
  def runtest(self, expected):
    if self.f() == expected:
      print(self.success)
    else:
      print(self.failure)

t1 = Test(lambda: "correct")
t1.runtest("correct") # "Test passed"
t1.runtest("incorrect") # "Test failed"
}

}

A few things to note:

@itemlist[

  @item{The @code{Test} class declares @code{object} to be its superclass by
  putting @code{object} in the parentheses of the class
  declaration,@note{Multiple comma-separated superclasses would yield multiple
  inheritance.}}

  @item{Calling the @code{Test} class value itself causes @code{__init__} to be
  called,}

  @item{The @code{__init__} method is purely side-affecting, and is passed an
  already-created (but not initialized) instance of the class,}

  @item{The method receiver @code{t1} is passed to the method @code{runtest}
  implicitly,}

  @item{The variables @code{success} and @code{failure} are available as fields
  on @code{self}.}

]

We tackle these features through desugaring the class form down to particular
object structures.  We can turn @code{Test} itself into an object whose class
is the builtin class @code{type}, and then assign its @(lp-term "__mro__")
field to the correct sequence of objects.  The desugaring below captures most
of the relevant details, though the full desugaring is slightly longer and more
complex:

@centered{
  @(lp-term ;; lp-term is just a wrapper around (with-rewriters ... render-term)
  (let (Test local = (object (id %type local) (meta-class 'Test))) in
  (let (t1 local = undefined) in
    (seq
    (assign (get-field Test "__mro__") := (tuple %tuple ((id Test local) (id %object local))))
    (seq
    (assign (get-field Test "__init__") := (fun (self f) (no-var) (assign (get-field self "f") := (id f local))))
    (seq
    (assign (get-field Test "success") := (object %str (meta-str "success")))
    (seq
    (assign (get-field Test "failure") := (object %str (meta-str "failure")))
    (seq
    (assign (get-field Test "runtest") :=
      (fun (self expected) (no-var)
        (if (builtin-prim "==" (app (get-field (id self local) "f") ()) (id expected local))
            (app (get-field (id print global) "__call__") ((get-field (id self local) "success")))
            (app (get-field (id print global) "__call__") ((get-field (id self local) "failure"))))))
    (seq
    (assign t1 := (app (get-field Test "__call__") ((fun () (no-var) (object %str (meta-str "correct")) (no-var)))))
    (seq
    (app (get-field (get-field (id local t1) "runtest") "__call__") ((object %str (meta-str "correct"))))
    (app (get-field (get-field (id local t1) "runtest") "__call__") ((object %str (meta-str "incorrect"))))))))))))))
     

}

So, after this expression evaluates, @(lp-term obj) is an identifier bound to
an object whose class pointer points to the builtin object @(lp-term %type).
This new value has a @(lp-term meta-class) value stored as well, which
designates it as a class object.  The next line sets up the important @(lp-term
"__mro__") field on the class value, which will be used for future lookups on
instances of the class.  If more than one superclass had been given, a helper
would have been called here to resolve the superclass lookup order.  This can
be implemented in a function written in @(lambda-py), so it isn't an intrinsic
part of the semantics.

The next three lines perform an interesting transformation. First, the class
variables @(lp-term success) and @(lp-term failure) have been changed into
@emph{object assignments} on the class value itself, rather than being
let-bound variables.  Similarly, the function definition inside the class body
is turned into an assignment on the class, rather than a let-bound variable.
Clearly, these values do need to be stored on @(lp-term (id Test local)) at
some point, since they are later accessed.  We will return to the desugaring of
classes and scope later, since the desugaring presented here isn't quite the
whole story.

The last interesting line in the desugaring is where the @(lp-term "__call__")
field of @(lp-term (id Test local)) is applied.  This is the desugaring of all
the function applications shown here, but this one is interesting because of
where the @(lp-term "__call__") method is implemented.  We haven't set it on
the @(lp-term Test) value, so it must be somewhere in the @(lp-term "__mro__")
list of its class.  And indeed, it is the @(lp-term %type) class's @(lp-term
"__call__") method that is responsible for creating a new object value with
class @(lp-term (id Test local)), calling @(lp-term "__init__"), and returning
the resulting object.  The @(lp-term %type) class is defined separately from
desugaring as part of the initial environment that desugared code runs in; we
discuss more of these engineering decisions in [REF].  The interesting point is
that even class construction is deferred to a method on a built-in value; we
express all object creation with only @(lp-term (object e_cls mval)) expressions.

Left implicit in this desugaring is the @(lp-term self)-binding of @(lp-term
t1) in the two method calls [FILL this should be __getattribute__].

@subsection{Reflection}

Python has a number of reflective operations on the values in its object
system; we highlight a few examples here.

@verbatim{

class C(object):
  def method(self):
    pass

c = C()
c.__class__ is C # True

bound_method = c.method
bound_method.__self__ == c
# the object closed over as self is reachable
# through the __self__ field


}

These operations predominantly preserve @emph{integrity} while
compromising @emph{confidentiality}.  That is, the allow the user to observe
and copy values that are internal to objects, but not to change them if they
would affect the internals of the behavior of the object.

@subsection{Pythonic Patterns}

Pythonic objects can have a number of so-called @emph{magic fields} that allow
for overriding the behavior of built-in syntactic forms.  These magic fields
can be set anywhere in an object's inheritance hierarchy, and provide a lot of
the flexibility that Python is well-known for.

@section{Python, the Hard Parts}

Not all of Python has a semantics as straightforward as that presented so far.
It has a unique notion of scope, with new scope operators added in Python 3 to
provide some features of more traditional static scoping.  It also has powerful
implicit constructs for control flow, most notably generators.  We proceed by
presenting the behavior of Python's generators, how we'd like to express them
using traditional programming languages wisdom, and what we need to do so.

@subsection{Generators and Local CPS: A Semantics Parable}

Python has a built-in notion of @emph{generators}, which provide a control-flow
construct, @code{yield}, that can implement lazy or generative sequences and
coroutines.  The programmer interface for creating a generator in Python is
straightforward: any function definition that uses the @code{yield} keyword in
its body is automatically converted into an object with so-called generator
interface.  To illustrate the easy transition from function to generator,
consider this (perhaps foolish) program in Python:

@verbatim{

def f():
  x = 0
  while True:
    x += 1
    return x

f() # evaluates to 1
f() # evaluates to 1
# ...

}

This function, when called, always starts what would be an infinite loop if it
didn't immediately return @code{1}.  By changing the {\tt return} statement to
a @code{yield} statement, a generator is created instead that can produce an
arbitrary number of such values:

@verbatim{

def f():
  x = 0
  while True:
    x += 1
    yield x

gen = f()
gen.next() # evaluates to 1
gen.next() # evaluates to 2
gen.next() # evaluates to 3
# ...

}

The application @code{f()} no longer immediately evaluates the body of the
function.  Instead, it creates an object with (at least) a @code{next} method.
When @code{next} is invoked, it evaluates up to the next {\tt yield} statement,
returns the value provided there, and stores its state for future @code{next}
calls.  The documentation of @code{yield} says as much (emphasis added) [FILL
figure out blockquote]:

``...the execution proceeds to the first @code{yield} expression, where it is
suspended again, returning the value of [the @code{yield expression}] to the
generator's caller. By suspended we mean that @emph{all local state is retained,
including the current bindings of local variables, the instruction pointer, and
the internal evaluation stack}. When the execution is resumed by calling one of
the generator's methods, the function can proceed exactly as if the yield
expression was just another external
call.@note{http://docs.python.org/release/3.2.3/reference/expressions.html?highlight=generator#yield-expressions}''

The emphasized text above highlights that the behavior of generators is
dependent on the storage of @emph{local} state and variables.  This implies
that the generator shouldn't need to, for example, keep track of the evaluation
stack or variables of @emph{other} functions.  It is careful to point out that
uses of yield can be treated as such an external function call, as well.
Further, since @code{yield} is a keyword, and not a value, a generator cannot
delegate the ability to @code{yield} to another function, maintaining the
locality of the operation.

To the discerning functional programmer, this well-defined design immediately
suggests an implementation strategy: a local continuation-passing style (CPS)
transformation.  The usual drawback of CPS---that it is a full-program
transformation---is alleviated by the careful restriction of @code{yield} to a
local operation.  That is, generators could be implemented by reifying all
local control operators into first-class functions and applications, and using
a bit of state to store a function representing the rest of the computation at
each @code{yield} point.  With this transformation, generators could be
understood completely in terms of a rewriting to existing constructs that is
local to function bodies.

@subsection{A (Local) CPS Transformation for Python}

Being somewhat discerning functional programmers, we began by attempting to
implement a CPS transformation for Python.  To implement a local CPS
transformation, we needed to take the operators that could cause local control
flow and reify each into a continuation function and an appropriate
application.  These operators include simple sequences, loops combined with
@code{break} and @code{continue}, and @code{try-except} and @code{try-finally}
combined with @code{raise} (generators cannot use @code{return}).

Our transformations introduce functions that accepted a continuation for each
possible kind of control operator, and turns uses of control operators into
applications of the appropriate continuation.  For example, a @code{try-except}
block can be changed from:

@verbatim{

try:
  raise Exception()
except e:
  print(e)

}

To:

@verbatim{

def except_handler(e): print(e)
except_handler(Exception())

}

In the case of generators, a sketch of a solution for rewriting @code{yield}
with CPS would involve creating a handler that stores a function holding the
code for what to do next, and rewriting @code{yield} expressions to call that
handler:

@verbatim{

def f():
  x = 1
  yield x
  x += 1
  yield x

g = f()
g.next() # evaluates to 1
g.next() # evaluates to 2
g.next() # throws "StopIteration"

}

Would be rewritten to something like:@note{ This is a sketch, not
the true output of an automated process, so we've taken liberties
with the variable names and continuations' construction. We use a
dictionary for @code{"next"} to avoid verbose object
construction.} 

@verbatim{

def f():

  def yielder(val, rest_of_function):
    next.to_call_next = rest_of_function
    return val

  def next():
    return next.to_call_next()

  def done(): raise StopIteration()
  def start():
    x = 1
    def rest():
      x += 1
      return yielder(x, done)
    return yielder(x, rest)

  next.to_call_next = start

  return { 'next' : next }

g = f()
g.['next']() # evaluates to 1
g.['next']() # evaluates to 2
g.['next']() # throws "StopIteration"

}

We build the @code{yielder} function, which takes a value, which it returns
after storing a continuation argument in the @code{to_call_next} field.  The
@code{next} function always returns the result of calling this stored value.
Each @code{yield} statement is rewritten to put everything after it into a new
function definition, which is passed to the call to @code{yielder}.

This rewriting is well-intentioned but does not work.  If this
program is run under Python, it results in an error:

@verbatim{
    x += 1
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x'
                   referenced before assignment
}

This is because Python creates a @emph{new scope} for each function
definition, and assignments within that scope create new variables.
In the body of @code{rest}, the assignment @code{x += 1} refers to a
new @code{x}, not the one defined by @code{x = 1} in @code{start}.  This
runs counter to traditional notions of functions that can close over
mutable variables.  And in general, with multiple assignment
statements and branching control flow, it is completely unclear if a
CPS transformation to Python function definitions can work.

The lesson from this example is that the @emph{interaction} of non-traditional
scope and control flow made a traditional normal-form translation (rewriting to
CPS) not work.  The straightforward CPS solution, which doesn't require
extending the number of concepts in the language, is inexpressible in Python
due to the mechanics of variable binding.  We'll move on to describing how we
can express Pythonic scope in a more traditional lexical model, and later we
will return to a CPS transformation that does work for Python's generators.

@section{Scope}

Python has a rich notion of scope, with several types of variables and implicit
binding semantics that depend on the block structure of the program.  Most
identifiers are @code{local}; this includes function parameters and variables
defined with the @code{=} operator.  There are also @code{global} and
@code{nonlocal} variables, with their own special semantics within closures,
and interaction with classes.  Our core contribution to explaining Python's
scope is to give a desugaring of the @code{nonlocal} and @code{global}
keywords, along with implicit @code{local}, @code{global} and @code{instance}
identifiers, into traditional lexically scoped closures. 
Global scope is still handled specially, since it exhibits a form of dynamic
scope that isn't straightforward to capture with traditional
let-bindings.@note{We actually exploit this dynamic scope in bootstrapping
Python's object system [REF]}

We proceed by describing Python's handling of scope for local variables, the
extension to @code{nonlocal}, and the interaction of both of these features with
classes.

@subsection{Declaring and Updating Local Variables}

In Python, the assignment operator @code{=} performs local variable binding:

@verbatim{

def f():
  x = 'local variable'
  return x

f() # evaluates to 'local variable'

}

The syntax for updating and creating a local variable are identical, so
subsequent @code{=} statements mutate the variable created by the first.

@verbatim{

def f():
  x = 'local variable'
  x = 'reassigned'
  x = 'reassigned again'
  return x

f() # evaluates to 'reassigned again'

}

It is a crucial point that there is @emph{no syntactic difference} between a
statement that updates a variable and one that initially binds it.  This fact,
combined with the fact that bindings can occur within branching statements as
well, so it isn't statically determinable if a variable will be defined at
certain program points.  Note also that variable declarations are not scoped to
all blocks---here they are scoped to function definitions:

@verbatim{
import random
def f():
  if random.random() > .5: x = 'big'
  else                   : pass
  return x

f() # either evaluates to 'big' or
    # throws an exception
}

@; I moved the desugaring for local scope and nonlocal scope to after the 
@; discussion of python's scope.  I don't have a strong preference for the 
@; ordering, I just wanted the desugaring discussion to be compacted for the
@; purposes of writing.  --matthew

@subsection{Closing Over Variables}

Bindings from outer scopes can be @emph{seen} by inner scopes:

@verbatim{
def f():
  x = 'closed-over-variable'
  def g()
    return x
  return g

f()() # evaluates to 'closed-over-variable'
}

However, since @code{=} defines a new local variable, one cannot close over a
variable and mutate it with the constructs we've seen so far; @code{=} simply
defines a new variable with the same name.  This was the underlying problem
with the attempted CPS translation from the last section, and a manifestation
of the difficulty of having the same syntactic form for both variable binding
and update.

@verbatim{
def g():
  x = 'not affected by h'
  def h()
    x = 'inner x'
    return x
  return (x, h())

g() # evaluates to
    # ('not affected by h', 'inner x')
}

Closing over a mutation is, however, a common and useful pattern.  Perhaps
recognizing this, with Python 3.0 came a new keyword to allow this pattern,
@code{nonlocal}.  A function definition can include a @code{nonlocal}
declaration at the top, which allows mutations within the function's body to
refer to variables in enclosing scopes.  If we add such a declaration to the
previous example, we get a different answer:

@verbatim{

def g():
  x = 'not affected by h'
  def h():
    nonlocal x
    x = 'inner x'
    return x
  return (h(), x)

g() # evaluates to
    # ('inner x', 'inner x')

}

The @code{nonlocal} declaration allows the inner assignment to @code{x} to
``see'' the outer binding from @code{g}.  This effect can span any nesting
depth of functions:

@verbatim{

def g():
  x = 'not affected by h'
  def h():
    def h2():
      nonlocal x
      x = 'inner x'
      return x
    return h2
  return (h()(), x)

g() # evaluates to
    # ('inner x', 'inner x')

}

Thus, the presence or absence of a @code{nonlocal} declaration can change an
assignment statement from a binding occurrence of a variable to an assigning
occurence.

@;{
TODO(joe): This is true, but we might not care

@subsection{Global vs Local Unbound Errors}

Uses of variables that are not defined at all attempt to look up the variable
in global scope and fail:

@verbatim{
def f():
  # x is not bound anywhere
  return x

f()
# yields "NameError: global name 'x' is not defined"
}

Python does, however, distinguish variables that may be declared locally but
haven't reached their assignment yet:

@verbatim{
def f():
  # x is not bound anywhere
  return x
  x = 'this will never happen'

f()
# yields "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x'
# referenced before assignment"
}

}

@subsection{Classes and Scope}

@figure*["f:class-scope" "Interactions between class bodies and function scope"]{
  @class-scope
}

We observe a different closure behavior for variables in a class definition than
we do for variables elsewhere in Python.  Consider the following example:

@verbatim{
def f(x, y):
  print(x); print(y); print("")
  class c:
    x = 4
    print(x); print(y)
    print(locals()["x"])
    print("")
    def g(self):
      print(x); print(y); print(c)
  return c

f("x-value", "y-value")().g()

}

When we execute this code, our 10 print statements are executed in the same order as they appear
in the source code.  We see this result:

@verbatim{

x-value
y-value

4
y-value
4

x-value
y-value
<class '__main__.c'>

}

Here we observe an interesting phenomenon: in the body of @code{g} the local variable created by the assignment x = 4
has seemingly vanished.  It is not closed over by the function @code{g}; the
body of @code{g} seems to "skip" the scope in
which x is bound to 4, instead closing over the outer scope in which @code{x}
is bound to @code{"x-value"}.
At first glance this does not appear to be compatible with our previous notions of Pythonic closures;
we will see, however, that the correct desugaring is capable of expressing the semantics of scope in 
Python's classes within the framework we have already established for dealing with python's scope.  

@subsection{Desugaring Scope}

@subsubsection{Desugaring for Local Scope}

Handling simple declarations of variables and updates to variables 
is straightforward to translate into a lexically-scoped
language.  @(lambda-py) has a usual @code{let} form that allows for lexical
binding.  In desugaring, we scan the body of the function and accumulate all
the variables on the left-hand side of assignment statements in the body.
These are let-bound at the top of the function to a special value, {\tt
Undefined}, which evaluates to an exception in any context other than a {\tt
let}-binding context.  We use @code{x := e} as the expression form for variable
assignment, which is not a binding form in the core.
So in @(lambda-py), the example above rewrites to:

@verbatim{
import random
def f():
  let x = Undefined in {
    if random.random() > .5: x := 'big'
    else                   : pass
    return x
  }

f() # either evaluates to 'big' or
    # throws an exception
}

This strategy is simple and works for variables defined in the branches of
@code{if} statements and loop bodies.  It is far from the whole story for
Pythonic scope, however.

@subsubsection{Desugaring for @code{nonlocal} Scope}

The rule for desugaring @code{nonlocal} variables refines this desugaring for
simple local variables.  In terms of purely lexical @code{let}-bindings, a
@code{nonlocal} declaration means that re-binding particular variables to
@code{Undefined} should be skipped.  So the program with a single @code{h}
above can be desugared to:

@verbatim{
def g():
  let x = Undefined in {
    x := 'not affected by h'
    def h():
      # no new binding added for x here!
      x := 'inner x'
      return x
    return (h(), x)
  }

g() # evaluates to
    # ('inner x', 'inner x')
}

@subsubsection{Desugaring classes}

Desugaring classes is substantially more complicated than handling simple
local and nonlocal cases.  Let's return to the example from section [REF],
stripped of print statements: 

@verbatim{
def f(x, y):
  class c:
    x = 4
    def g(self): pass
  return c
f("x-value", "y-value")().g()
}

In this example, we have three local scopes in play: the body of the function f,
the body of the class definition c, and the body of the function g.  We will refer
to these scopes as f-scope, c-scope, and g-scope.  c-scope can see bindings created
in f-scope.  g-scope can see bindings created in f-scope, but not bindings created in 
c-scope.  To accomplish this behavior @(lambda-py):

@itemlist[
  @item{Extracts all functions,}
  @item{Renames and rebinds them in f-scope,}
  @item{And replaces their bodies with calls to the newly-bound functions.}
]
  
Under this scheme our example would desugar as:

@verbatim{
def f(x, y):
  def extracted-g(self): pass
  class c: 
    x = 4
    def g(self): 
      return extracted-g(self)
  return c
f("x-value", "y-value")().g()

}

This preserves our desired semantics: the bodies of functions defined in 
c-scope will close over f-scope, and the statements written in c-scope 
will evaluate in c-scope.

@subsubsection{Desugaring classes: instance variables}

Though the semantics of closures defined in class bodies have been solved, 
We have yet to deal with the notion of instance variables - how does @code{"x = 4"}
go from creating a local variable in c-scope to creating an instance variable
in objects of class c?  To solve this problem, @(lambda-py) notes that there is no
apparent difference between classes which introduce identifiers in their body
and classes which introduce identifiers by field assignment.  That is,

@verbatim{
class c:
 x = 3
}

and 

@verbatim{
class c: pass
c.x = 3
}

will produce the same class.  This observation is the key insight into
@(lambda-py)'s treatment of instance variables.  We re-visit our now
well-trodden example:

@verbatim{
def f(x, y):
  class c:
    x = 4
    def g(self): pass
  return c
f("x-value", "y-value")().g()
}

In order to achieve Python's semantics, we desugar first to:

@verbatim{
def f(x, y):
  def extracted-g(self): pass
  class c: 
    x = 4
    def g(self): 
      return extracted-g(self)
  return c
f("x-value", "y-value")().g()
}

And to handle instance variables, we further desugar to:

@verbatim{
def f(x, y):
  let extracted-g = Undefined in 
    let c = Undefined in {
      extracted-g := def extracted-g(self): 
        pass
      c := class c: pass
      let x = Undefined in 
        let g = Undefined in {
          c.x = 4
          x = c.x
          c.g = def g(self): 
            return extracted-g(self)
          g = c.g
        }
      return c
    }
f("x-value", "y-value")().g()
}

We have thus achieved everything necessary for Python's class semantics; 
function bodies do not close over the class body's scope, class bodies
create their own local scope, statements in class bodies are executed sequentially 
and definitions/assignments in class bodies result in the creation of class
members.  The nonlocal and global keyword do not require special treatment 
beyond what we have outlined here, even when present in class bodies.

@subsection{Rest}

Most of Python's scope (with a few exceptions noted below), can be modelled
with a lexically-scoped core semantics.  Some operations do require
@emph{reifying} lexical scope into a value, but with very few exceptions, this
reification cannot be reflected back into ordinary variables and cause
dynamic-scope like behavior.

Existing editors use heuristics to figure out if variables could be bound to
particular instances.@note{http://wingware.com/doc/edit/points-of-use}
This makes variable naming refactorings less precise than in say, an IDE for
Java, requiring developer intervention to specify which instances should be
renamed.  We provide a more precise account of scope that would enable
correct points-of-use analysis for lexical variables in Python.

@section{Modules}

Python's module system combines Python's notions of objects and scope to both
get a representation of the global bindings in one module, and introduce them
as an object or bindings in another.  Some patterns of module importing are
strictly lexical, and can be modeled via inlining.  Others amount to dynamic
code loading that affects scope in a way that isn't determinable until runtime
time.

@section{Generators}

Via the @code{yield} statement, Python allows the automatic creation of
generator objects from function-like expression forms.  Generators and the {\tt
yield} operation are often modelled using local or delimited continuations, or
can be implemented explicitly with continuation-passing style.  However, due to
complications of @emph{scope}, a naive desugaring strategy for a CPS
transformation isn't effective.  We step through this initial approach on a
simple model of Python's scope, and then discuss how our different model of
desugaring scope helps fix the problems of this naive solution.

@section{Perspective}

@itemlist[

  @item{Many overloadings and implicit method calls are nice}

  @item{However, there are corner cases, and they have to do with the thing stuck in programmers' face: scope}

  @item{Unclear if scope behavior is a product of growing up from a dynamic language or intentional}

  @item{All the values of Python, all the scope of something saner, would be a really nice thing to have}
]

@section{Engineering \& Evaluation}

There are two properties we evaluated for @(lambda-py):

@verbatim{
\paragraph{Property 1: $\textit{desugar}$ is a total function:}
\begin{displaymath}
\forall p \in \textrm{\ Python}, \exists e \in \lambda_\pi \textit{\ such that\ }
\textit{desugar}(p) = e
\end{displaymath}

\paragraph{Property 2: $\textit{desugar}$ composed with $\rightarrow^*$ is accurate:}
\begin{displaymath}
\forall p \in \textrm{\ Python}, \textrm{if\ }
\textit{eval}_\textit{py}(p) = v
\textrm{\ then\ } \textit{desugar}(e) \rightarrow^* \textit{desugar}(v)
\end{displaymath}
}

We do not have a proof of either, since doing so would require formalizing
Python, which is our goal here in the first place.  In order to ascertain the
degree to which @(lambda-py) enjoys these properties, we @emph{test} our
semantics against Python's own unit test suite to confirm that our semantics
matches a real implementation (CPython).  We of course do not have perfect
fidelity to real-world Python for a number of reasons; in this section we
outline which tests we pass, which we fail, which are within reach, and which
are out of scope for the semantics we've presented. We begin with an overview
of the engineering work that goes into implementing and testing the semantics,
and then discuss our results.

@subsection{Python Libraries in Python}

We implement as many libraries as possible in Python, with one small addition:
we define a small @emph{superset} of Python with macros that are recognized
specially by our desugaring to transform into particular @(lambda-py) forms.
This allows us to write implementations of libraries that more closely match
Pythonic descriptions of them, while still maintaining the guarantee that
everything is implementable in @(lambda-py) itself.

@subsection{Performance}

@(lambda-py) is a semantics first, and an implementation of the Python language
second.  From a semantics perspective, the performance of @(lambda-py) is
irrelevant:@note{For applications that don't rely on the timing behavior
of Python.} as long as it is an accurate model of Python's behavior, the
tool-builder can implement with respect to @(lambda-py) programs regardless of
their runtime.

However, to actually @emph{test} the semantics, we do require that the tests
complete at some point so we can iterate the design and regression test as we
add new features!  This required making a few engineering decisions to improve
performance to the point where running large programs and test suites is
possible.

In our initial implementation, the execution strategy had a few steps:

@itemlist[
  @item{Parse and desugar roughly 1 KLOC of libraries implemented in Python}
  @item{Parse and desugar the target program}
  @item{Built up a syntax tree of several built-in libraries, coded by building the AST directly in Racket}
  @item{Compose items 1-3 into a single @(lambda-py) expression}
  @item{Evaluate the @(lambda-py) expression}
]

Parsing and desugaring for 1 takes a nontrivial amount of time (on the order of
4 seconds on the first author's laptop).  When running a suite of tests in
order, this parsed syntax tree is the same for each test.  Switching to memoize
this parsing and desugaring for the duration of a test run cut the time for
running 100 tests from around 7 minutes to around 22 seconds.  A corollary is
that evaluating @(lambda-py) programs is relatively quick, but desugaring and
loading external files is not.
